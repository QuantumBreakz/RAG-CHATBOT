      "content": "According to the provided document context, the Lewis concept of acids and bases states that:\n\n* An acid is a substance (molecule or ion) which can **accept** a pair of electrons.\n* A base is a substance (molecule or ion) which can **donate** a pair of electrons.\n\nIn other words, acids are electron pair acceptors, while bases are electron pair donors. This concept broadens the definition of acids and bases beyond the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry concepts, which were limited to substances containing protons (H+).",

      "content": "Based on the provided context from test_document.pdf and mcqs_output_fixed.pdf, I will verify each MCQ answer.\n\n**MCQ 1:** Punjab Procurement Rules 2009 will be strictly followed in the bidding process for EOI.\nAccording to the context, there is no mention of the specific rules being applied. However, it does mention that \"Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) at its exclusive discretion may ask the participating companies/firms for clarifications on their proposals.\" This implies that the rules might be followed, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I would say:\nCorrect Answer: B) False\n\n**MCQ 2:** The registration fee for submitting EOI is Rs. 5000.\nThe context does not specify a registration fee for submitting EOI. In fact, it states that participating firms/companies are required to respond within 2 working days from receipt of the written request for clarification.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I would say:\nCorrect Answer: B) False\n\n**MCQ 3:** Proposals must be delivered to Tender Box No.2 at PITB Lahore.\nAccording to the context, it states that \"The participating firms/companies shall submit their proposals at the address given above on or before 1500 Hrs, 21st August 2013.\" There is no mention of a specific location for delivery.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I would say:\nCorrect Answer: B) False\n\n**MCQ 4:** The EOI proposals will remain valid for 365 days from the date of opening.\nThe context actually states that \"Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) may for any reason, modify the EOI proposals from time to time. The amendment(s) to the EOI would be clearly spelt out and the participating firms/companies may be asked to amend their proposal due to such amendments.\" There is no mention of a specific validity period.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I would say:\nCorrect Answer: B) False\n\n**MCQ 5:** Participating firms must provide a copy of ISO 9001:2008 certificate.\nThe context does not specifically mention this requirement. However, it does ask for information on \"Provide information on current or past litigation or arbitration over the last three (3) years as shown in the form below.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, I would say:\nCorrect Answer: B) FalseBased on the provided context from test_document.pdf and mcqs_output_fixed.pdf, I will verify each MCQ answer.\n\n**MCQ 1:** Punjab Procurement Rules 2009 will be strictly followed in the bidding process for EOI.\nAccording to the context, there is no mention of the specific rules being applied.
